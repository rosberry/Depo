# Depo :station:
The dependency managers wrapper. 

+ Use Carthage, Pods and SwiftPackages in single project easily.
+ Manage Cartfile, Podfile and Package.swift by single **Depofile** file. 
+ Update and install Carthage, Pods and Swift Packages by single command
+ Build Pods into actual **frameworks** (like Carthage did) and just add them into your `xcodeproj`. No more `xcworkspacecs` and other weird-pods stuff
