# Depo :station:
The dependency managers wrapper. 

+ Use Carthage, Pods and SwiftPackages in single project easily.
+ Manage Cartfile, Podfile and Package.swift by single **Depofile** file. 
+ Update and install Carthage, Pods and Swift Packages by single command
+ Build Pods into actual **frameworks** (like Carthage did) and just add them into your `xcodeproj`. No more `xcworkspacecs` and other weird-pods stuff

## Requirements

- Swift 5.3+

## Installation
### Homebrew
```
brew install rosberry/tap/depo
```

### Makefile
```
git clone git@github.com:rosberry/Depo.git
cd Depo
make
```

## Usage
### Example
```
depo init <PATH_TO_CARTFILE> <PATH_TO_PODFILE> <PATH_TO_PACKAGE_SWIFT>
depo install
```

### Depofile
Depofile is a file, which compose Cartfile, Podfile and Package.swift. For each file there is a section: carts, pods and swiftPackages. Each section has items, and for example items from 'swiftPackages' section should have `name` `url` and `version` -- as they have it in original Package.swift. For more information look at [Depofile Example](./DepofileExample.yaml)
